			<h3>The Mountain Sutra</h3>
			
			<p class="content-zi3">
			<b><i>The Mountain Sutra is divided into five volumes: the South Mountain Sutra, the West Mountain Sutra, the North Mountain Sutra, the East Mountain Sutra, and the Middle Mountain Sutra, which are mainly about the mountains of ancient geography.</i></b>
			<br /><br />
			<b>The Southern Mountain Sutra</b>, which covers a total of forty mountains, from the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province in the east to the western part of Hunan Province in the west and the South China Sea in Guangdong Province in the south, covers the five provinces of Zhejiang, Gan, Fujian, Guangdong and Hunan today, spanning a total of 16,380 miles.
			<br /><br />
			<b>The Western Mountain Sutra</b>, which describes 77 mountains, spans 17,517 miles, from the Yellow River between Shan and Shaanxi in the east, the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi and Gansu in the south, northwest of Yanchi in Ningxia, and northwest of Arjinshan in Xinjiang.
			<br /><br />
			<b>The Northern Mountains Sutra</b> describes a total of eighty-seven mountains, starting from the Helan Mountains in the Tengger Desert in Inner Mongolia and Ningxia in the west, reaching the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains in Hebei in the east and the north of the Yin Mountains in Inner Mongolia in the north, spanning twenty-three thousand two hundred and thirty miles. The North Mountain Sutra is less mythical than the other mountain sutras, and although it contains many exotic animals, the mythological resources are limited, which is an important feature of the North Mountain Sutra.
			<br /><br />
			<b>The Eastern Mountain Sutra</b>, which covers forty-six mountains, including present-day Shandong and the northern border of Suwan, spans 18,860 miles.
			<br /><br />
			<b>The Zhongshan Sutra</b>, with its one hundred and ninety-seven mountains, reaches to the north-western edge of the Sichuan basin in the west, spanning 21,371 miles.

            <h3>The Sea Sutra</h3>
			

			<p class="content-zi4"><b><i>In the Sea Sutra, the two parts of the Overseas Sutra and the Great Desolation Sutra have a special connection. The Great Wilderness Sutra consists of five parts: the Great Wilderness East Sutra, the Great Wilderness South Sutra, the Great Wilderness West Sutra, the Great Wilderness North Sutra and the Sea Within Sutra. The four quarters of the Wilderness Sutra describe the mountains and square countries of the four quarters in order of orientation: east, south, west and north, presenting a picture of mountains surrounded by mountains.</i></b>
			<br /><br />
			The accounts of <b>faraway and exotic lands </b>in the Great Desolate Sutra overlap with the Overseas Sutra to such an extent that studies such as that of Hao Yixing have suggested that the Great Desolate Sutra was actually used to interpret the Overseas Sutra.
			<br /><br />
			Compared with the Overseas Sutra, the Great Desolate Sutra contains not only descriptions of<b> foreign countries</b>, but also many more accounts of <b>mountains, rivers, geography and tribal lineages</b>. The Overseas Sutra, on the other hand, contains many more descriptions of <b>gods and monsters</b> than the Great Desolate Sutra, and relatively less of the near-geography of mountains, rivers and water. Unlike the Mountain Sutra, in which the animals are often described with aural and gustatory descriptions such as "their sounds are like" and "their tastes", the text of the Dawei Sutra is mostly static, and therefore also has traces of graphic descriptions, which Mr. Zhong Jingwen considers to be an aid to graphic composition. However, the records of the other country's surnames in the Dahuangjing cannot be directly derived from a single picture, so they are also thought to be anecdotal accounts by the picture tellers, or supplementary accounts by later generations.
			<br /><br />
			The Dahuangjing also contains an astronomical account of <b>ancient times</b>, in which it is recorded that there are seven mountains in the east and seven mountains in the west from which the sun and moon emerge and into which they enter. <i>Chen Fengheng, a scholar of the Qing Dynasty, believed that these seven mountains were actually observations of the movement of the sun and moon, and were related to seasonal customs.</i>
			<br /><br />
			And the Overseas Classic also contains descriptions of <b>the gods of the four directions</b>. The gods Zhu Rong, the god of the South Overseas Classic, Matsui, the god of the West Overseas Classic, Yu Qiang, the god of the North Overseas Classic, and Jumang, the god of the East Overseas Classic, live in the East, South, West and North quadrants of the world picture depicted in the Overseas Classic, corresponding to the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter, and they are both the gods of the four quadrants and the gods of the four seasons.
