			<b>As a pre-Qin encyclopaedia, the medical value of the Classic of Mountains and Seas is not to be underestimated. </b>The medicines it contains include animal, botanical and mineral medicines, among which botanicals are divided into herbs and woody plants. Some of these medicinal plants are used to treat illnesses, while others are used to nourish and strengthen the body.
			<br /><br />
			<i>In addition to treating illnesses and diseases, there are even remedies for livestock,</i> which, together with energising and wise medicines, helped to overcome the difficulties of marching. Some later generations regarded it as a travel guide, also because of its descriptions of mountain medicine and even medicinal prescriptions.
			<br /><br />
			<b>The mountains are described in the Shanjing using vegetation conditions and soil textures, and there are many records of plants of both sexes for medicine and food, laying the foundation for herbal medicine. </b>According to statistics, there are about twenty-eight species of healing grasses and twenty-one species of wood recorded in the Shan Hai Jing. The ancestors not only depicted the colour patterns of the stems and leaves and the shapes of the fruits of the plants and taught people how to recognise them, but also introduced their efficacy and methods of use.
            <br /><br />
			Three of the edible plants mentioned in the Nanshanjing are Zhuyu, Wow and Baiji. The latter two are woody plants with medicinal value. Two woody plants with medicinal value are found in the Eastern Mountain Classic, namely muyu and panicum. Most of the mountains and rivers in the Bei Shan Jing are 'devoid of grasses and trees', let alone herbs of medicinal value.<br /><br /></p>
